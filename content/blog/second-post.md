# Automating Your Zola Blog

In this post, I'll show you how to set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy your Zola blog.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your software workflows directly in your repository.

## Benefits

With GitHub Actions, you can:

1. Automatically build your site on every push
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Preview pull requests before merging
4. Run tests and checks

## The Workflow

The workflow includes:

- Installing Zola
- Building the static site
- Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Creating PR previews for review

This automation saves time and ensures your site is always up to date!
