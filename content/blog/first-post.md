# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator written in Rust.

## Why Zola?

Zola offers several advantages:

- **Fast**: Written in Rust, it's incredibly fast at building sites
- **Single binary**: No dependencies to install
- **Built-in features**: Syntax highlighting, Sass compilation, and more
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and use

## Automated Deployment

This blog is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions. Every time I push to the main branch, the site is rebuilt and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## What's Next?

I'll be writing more posts about:

- Web development
- DevOps practices
- Programming tutorials
- And more!

Stay tuned!
